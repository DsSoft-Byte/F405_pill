## VERSIONS:
* The [F405_pill_V1.0](https://github.com/davidmolony/F405_pill/tree/RELEASE_V1.0) has been deprecated. 
* The [F405_pill_V1.11](https://github.com/davidmolony/F405_pill/tree/main/F405_pill_V1.11) has an additional 100nF cap on the input to PA4 (throttle) and we suggest you use this for ordering.

## HOW TO COMPILE FIRMWARE YOURSELF
* Precompiled V6.05 Firmware is included, see MP2.bin
* Clone bldc "VESC Repo" and download "VESC Headers" Directory, use the "hw_MP2.c" and hw_MP2.h" files, put these into bldc/hwconf/trampa/100_250 and rename them to "hw_100_250.c" and "hw100_250.h" respectively, leave out the V3. run make on the 100_250 making sure you have all dependencies installed.

## V1.1 changes

* Xtal caps from 18pF to 12pF
* Separate the two LEDs from the single resistor
* CAN spike protection
* RC between GND and pb12 to stop false trips
* PC12->PA15 to drive LED
* Increased functionality of several header pins
* Review [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/133GiePRK8IwF3s6afCpwSXIvTwbwvJINTHfW9RnuX6c/edit) for pin changes

## REVISION REQUEST

* Jumper to disable CAN termination resistor on bottom side of board
